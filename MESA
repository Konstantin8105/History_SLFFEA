Here are instructions to install Mesa taken from my GNU/Linux FAQ:

   15.3.0  Compiling Mesa Programs

        15.3.1 From the /Mesa-3.0/README:

                    To compile the library, first type 'make' alone to  see  the
                    list  of  system configurations currently supported.  If you
                    see your configuration on the list,  type  'make  <config>'.
                    Most popular Unix/X workstations are currently supported.

               For my machine, I use:

                    make linux

        15.3.2 Header Files and Libraries

               From the /Mesa-3.0/README:


                    Header and library files:
                       After you've compiled Mesa and tried the demos I recommend the following
                       procedure for "installing" Mesa.

                       Copy the Mesa include/GL directory to /usr/local/include:


                        mkdir /usr/local/include/GL
                        cp -d include/GL/* /usr/local/include/GL/


                       Copy the Mesa library files to /usr/local/lib:


                        cp -d lib/* /usr/local/lib


                            (actually, use "cp -d" on Linux to preserve symbolic
                    links)

                       Create a few symbolic  links  so  that  compiling  OpenGL
                    applications is easy:


                        cd /usr/local/lib
                        ln -s libMesaGL.a libGL.a
                        ln -s libMesaGLU.a libGLU.a


        15.3.3 Install Widgets-Mesa Library

               You also need to install the Widgets-Mesa Library.  First:

                     cd  /usr/local/Mesa-3.0/widgets-mesa/

               The file /usr/local/Mesa-3.0/widgets-mesa/INSTALL tells you to:


                        ./configure
                        make
                        make demo.gl
                        make demo.mesa
                        make demo.ws
                        make demo.tea
                        make install

               Now do:

                     cd /usr/local/lib
                     ln -s libMesaGLw.a libGLw.a
