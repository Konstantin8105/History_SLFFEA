                    homepage:  http://slffea.sourceforge.net/


First let me iterate that SLFFEA contains 6 of the basic element types:

1. beam    3-D 2 node beam (Euler-Bernoulli Non-shear deformable)
2. brick       8 node brick
3. plate       4 node plate
4. quad        4 node quad - plane stress or plane strain
5. shell       4 node doubly curved shell (individual element defined by 8 nodes)
6. truss   3-D 2 node truss

1 non-linear large deformation element:

1. brick       8 node brick - updated Lagrange formulation with Jaumann Stress Rate

And 1 thermal element(added on 5/6/00):

1. brick       8 node brick - allows for thermal loads and orthotropy

7 Graphical User Interfaces for each element type.


Naming Conventions:
------------------

There are 6 directories corresponding to the 6 basic element types.  Within
each are at least 2 directories: one which contains the source for the
basic element type and one for the GUI associated with that element.  All
GUI directories have a "_gr" extension.  For instance, in the slffea-1.1/plate/
directory, there is the plate and plate_gr directories. 

There are 2 common directories, one for the common scientific functions and
one for the common graphics functions.

The names of the source files adhere to the following naming conventions:
