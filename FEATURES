P-Winston Motion Engine:
-----------------------

One of the best features of the GUI is the P-Winston Motion Engine.  Activate
the Mesh Window and move the mouse around.  You will notice that you
have the entire range of motion including zooming in and out, moving up and
down and left and right, and rotation on every axis.  The P-Winston
Motion Engine was written by Philip Winston who graciously allowed its
inclusion into SLFFEA.

WARNING !!
_______________________________________

Pressing the hotkeys 'e', 'm', 'n' will make the command line prompt
you for the desired element, material, and node to identify respectively.
Everything will freeze until you give an input number.  And pressing 'g'
will prompt you for a new data file.

Hotkeys(the mesh window must be active):
---------------------------------------

There are also several Hot Keys which have features not shown on the control Panel.
Among these are render, screen dump, and switching from perspective to orthographic
viewing.  A complete list is given below:

 i - move in 
 o - move out 
 e - Element ID (use command line input to ID desired element)

             1 - strain or curvature xx
             2 - strain or curvature yy
             3 - strain zz
             4 - strain or curvature xy
             5 - strain zx
             6 - strain yz
             7 - strain or curvature I
             8 - strain or curvature II
             9 - strain III
  <shift>1 = ! - stress or moment xx
  <shift>2 = @ - stress or moment yy
  <shift>3 = # - stress zz
  <shift>4 = $ - stress or moment xy
  <shift>5 = % - stress zx
  <shift>6 = ^ - stress yz
  <shift>7 = & - stress or moment I
  <shift>8 = * - stress or moment II
  <shift>9 = ( - stress III

 0 - displacement Ux
 - - displacement Uy
 = - displacement Uz
 [ - Rotation Phi x or temperature
 ] - Rotation Phi y or heat
 \ - Rotation Phi z
 m - material ID (use command line input to ID desired material)
 n - node ID (use command line input to ID desired node)
 > - increase deformed mesh amplification  *
 < - decrease deformed mesh amplification
 a - turns on and off the deformed mesh 
 b - turns on and off the undeformed mesh 
 d - turns on and off the applied displacement or angle vectors 
 c - Reset the rotation 
 v - Reset the translation 
 h - Display statistical information about mesh.  Reread in *view.dat file
     which can be modified to narrow or expand range of maximum and
     minimum values.
 j - turns on and off element outlines
 p - switches between perspective and orthographic viewing
 f - turns on and off the applied forces or moments
 q - quits
 r - turns on and off rendering
 s - turns on and off cutting planes
        with cutting planes activated, arrow keys move the x and y cutting planes
        rather than move the mesh and < and > move the z cutting plane.
 t - turns on and off transparency
 w - turns on and off wire frame(for beam, turns on or off distributed load)
 x - turns on or off axes
 y - screen dump
 arrow keys - move mesh accordingly

* Amplifications are scaled based on the largest deformation and the
  largest spatial dimension.  


SS-GUI:
------

Because the GUI is completely built on the OpenGL emulator Mesa, I made
the GUI self-scaling.  This means if you resize the Control Panel window,
the text will shrink proportionally and the GUI will work exactly the same.


Both Pre-Post Processor:
-----------------------

This GUI works as both a post-processor and a pre-processor.  You can use the
GUI to just look at an input mesh and see if it is correct before running an
analysis on it.


Hotkeys Revisited:
-----------------

Let me say again that you can make a screendump with 'y', turn on rendering
with 'r', toggle the perspective with 'p', and quit with 'q'.
